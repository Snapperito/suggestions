<b>**Will there ever be a mobile (Android/iOS) version of Vizality?**</b><br>
No, the mobile versions of Discord work completely differently and are not compatible with Vizality and no separate entity will be worked on.
#
<b>**Is Vizality compatible with other client mod plugins?**</b><br>
No, Vizality is not directly compatible with other client mod plugins. Although someone could possibly make a plugin for it. We are planning on porting over or recreating popular plugins or plugins by request, however.

## Development
#
<b>**Why is it slow when checking a source in Dev Tools?**</b><br>
This seems to be a weird bug. Open Dev Tools Settings (F1), go to the Experiments tab and enable "Automatically pretty print in the Sources Panel" and sources will now load much faster in Dev Tools.

## Server
#
<b>**How do I report another member for inappropriate behavior?**</b><br>
Use the report command in the form of `!report <@user> <reason>`. If you want to include a screenshot, that's even more helpful. Just attach it to the command message.
